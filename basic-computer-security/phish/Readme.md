## Steps to create a phishing site.

create index.html and fish.php

index.html is created using source code of website(facebook.com)

change ==> action = fish.php and method = fish.php in index.html(use text editer)

create an account for webhosting
(for free by signingup ==> https://www.000webhost.com/ )

create website name remember the password for later signins

upload index.php and fish.php and get the link by clicking file manager

webhost give you a website name; for my case below is my website name

==>   https://faacedock.000webhostapp.com

send the link to friends and ask them to enter.

check the passwords.txt in the filemanger (webhosting site)

hurray!! you got your friends password in passwords.txt

(if the website knows that your website index.html sourcecode is similar to main website, then it will block your webhosting account.)
